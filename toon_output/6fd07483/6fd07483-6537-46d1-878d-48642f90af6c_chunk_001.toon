[17:58:29] USER: Implement the following plan:

# Dougable PostgreSQL + pgvector Installation

## Context

The GUI installer offers PostgreSQL as a database option but doesn't actually install it. A non-dev user (Doug) selects PostgreSQL, types a connection URL, and gets a failed connection because Postgres isn't installed. The installer should handle installing PostgreSQL and pgvector automatically, the same way it handles Ollama — detect, offer, install.

**Key constraint:** Doug is not a developer. No Docker, no Visual Studio, no build tools. Only winget and a web browser. pgvector has no official prebuilt Windows binaries — we use community builds from `pgvector/pgvector` Windows packages or `andreiramani/pgvector_pgsql_windows`.

## Plan

### 1. Detection — `installer/shared/detect.py`

Add `PostgresInfo` dataclass and `detect_postgres()` function following the existing `OllamaInfo`/`detect_ollama()` pattern:

```python
@dataclass
class PostgresInfo:
    installed: bool = False
    running: bool = False
    version: str = ""
    install_dir: Optional[Path] = None  # e.g. C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16
    has_pgvector: bool = False
```

Detection strategy:
- Run `pg_config --version` to check if installed + get version
- Try `pg_isready` to check if running
- Find install dir via `pg_config --libdir` (most reliable cross-platform)
- Check for pgvector: look for `vector.control` in the extension dir (`pg_config --sharedir` / `extension/`)

Add `postgres: PostgresInfo` field to `SystemInfo`.

### 2. Installation functions — `installer/shared/install_core.py`

**`install_postgres(plat, progress) -> InstallResult`**
- Windows: `winget install PostgreSQL.PostgreSQL.16 --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-16` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install -y postgresql16-server` (Fedora)
- macOS: `brew install postgresql@16`
- Timeout: 600s (large download)
- After install: verify with `pg_isready` (may need a short sleep for service startup)

**`install_pgvector(plat, pg_info, progress) -> InstallResult`**
- Windows: Download prebuilt zip from `andreiramani/pgvector_pgsql_windows` GitHub releases, extract `vector.dll` → `{pg_libdir}/`, `vector.control` + SQL files → `{pg_sharedir}/extension/`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-16-pgvector` (one command, handles everything)
- macOS: `brew install pgvector`
- After file copy (Windows): run `psql -U postgres -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector"` against the target database

**`setup_postgres_database(pg_url, progress) -> InstallResult`**
- Create the `memory_palace` database if it doesn't exist: `psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE memory_palace"`
- Enable pgvector: `psql -U postgres -d memory_palace -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector"`
- Test connection with the full URL

### 3. GUI flow — `installer/gui/app.py`

**Detection screen** (`_run_detection`): Add a "PostgreSQL" row to the detection checks. Shows status like "Not installed", "Installed (v16.2)", "Installed + pgvector".

**Options screen** (`_show_options`): When user selects PostgreSQL radio button:
- If not detected: show inline note "PostgreSQL not found — will be installed automatically"
- If detected but no pgvector: show "pgvector extension will be installed"
- If both present: show "Ready" in green

**Install flow** (`_run_install`): When db_type is "postgres":
- Step: Install PostgreSQL if not detected (winget)
- Step: Install pgvector if not present
- Step: Create database + enable extension
- Step: Test connection (existing code)
- All steps are non-fatal with clear error messages + "you can configure this later"

### 4. Windows-specific details

**Finding Postgres after winget install:**
- winget installs to `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\`
- May need to add `bin/` to PATH or use full paths for `psql`, `pg_config`
- Service starts automatically after install
- Default superuser: `postgres` with password set during install (winget silent install may use default)

**pgvector prebuilt source:**
- `https://github.com/andreiramani/pgvector_pgsql_windows/releases`
- Download the zip matching PG major version
- Extract: `vector.dll` → `lib/`, `vector--*.sql` + `vector.control` → `share/extension/`
- Requires admin privileges for file copy to Program Files

**Admin privileges:**
- winget install may trigger UAC prompt (expected, no way around it)
- File copy to `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\` requires elevation
- The installer should detect if it has admin rights and prompt if needed

### Files

| File | Action |
|---|---|
| `installer/shared/detect.py` | **Modify** — add `PostgresInfo`, `detect_postgres()`, update `SystemInfo` |
| `installer/shared/install_core.py` | **Modify** — add `install_postgres()`, `install_pgvector()`, `setup_postgres_database()` |
| `installer/gui/app.py` | **Modify** — postgres detection row, conditional install during progress |

### Verification

1. Run installer on a machine without PostgreSQL — should offer to install
2. After install, pgvector extension should be available
3. `CREATE EXTENSION vector` succeeds
4. Memory Palace can connect and create tables
5. Full flow: fresh Windows machine → double-click .exe → select PostgreSQL → click Install → everything works

[17:59:05] ASSISTANT: 🗨️ Internal Chat ────────────────────────────────
Sandy_dev: Alright, three files, clean patterns to follow. The Ollama detection is our template.
iHeart_CarlSagan: pg_config --version, pg_isready, vector.control lookup. Elegant detection chain.
sequence_breaker: Windows path hell incoming. Program Files, winget, PATH shenanigans...
Sandy_dev: Let's fuckin' go. Task 1 first.
────────────────────────────────────────────────

[17:59:06] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: TaskUpdate]

[17:59:06] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[17:59:09] ASSISTANT: Starting with `detect.py` — adding `PostgresInfo` dataclass and `detect_postgres()`:

[17:59:13] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[17:59:14] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[17:59:16] ASSISTANT: Now add `detect_postgres()` and wire it into `detect_all()`:

[17:59:26] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[17:59:26] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[17:59:28] ASSISTANT: Now wire `detect_postgres` into `detect_all()`:

[17:59:31] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[17:59:31] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[17:59:34] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: TaskUpdate]

[17:59:34] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[17:59:34] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: TaskUpdate]

[17:59:34] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[17:59:37] ASSISTANT: Now Task #2 — adding the three PostgreSQL install functions to `install_core.py`:

[17:59:39] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[17:59:39] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[17:59:41] ASSISTANT: Now add the three functions before `clone_or_update_repo`:

[18:00:26] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:00:26] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:00:29] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: TaskUpdate]

[18:00:29] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:00:30] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: TaskUpdate]

[18:00:30] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:00:34] ASSISTANT: Now Task #3 — updating the GUI. Three changes needed:
1. Add PostgreSQL row to detection screen
2. Add status messages on options screen when postgres is selected  
3. Add postgres/pgvector/database install steps during `_run_install`

First, update the imports in app.py:

[18:00:37] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:00:37] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:00:40] ASSISTANT: Next, add the PostgreSQL row to the detection screen checks:

[18:00:42] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:00:42] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:00:45] ASSISTANT: Now add the PostgreSQL detection result display in `_run_detection`, right after the Ollama section:

[18:00:49] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:00:50] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:00:53] ASSISTANT: Now update the options screen to show PostgreSQL status when the postgres radio button is selected. I need to enhance `_on_db_type_changed` and add a status label:

[18:00:58] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:00:59] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:02] ASSISTANT: Now add the `pg_status_frame` widget creation right after the `pg_url_frame` creation in `_show_options`:

[18:01:05] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:01:05] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:09] ASSISTANT: Now the big one — updating `_run_install` to handle PostgreSQL installation steps. I need to add postgres install, pgvector install, and database setup steps when `db_type == "postgres"`. Let me replace the database configuration section:

[18:01:14] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:01:14] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:17] ASSISTANT: Now replace the database configuration section in `_run_install` to add the PostgreSQL install steps:

[18:01:34] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Edit]

[18:01:35] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:38] ASSISTANT: Good. Let me verify the file looks correct — particularly the section I just edited and the surrounding context:

[18:01:39] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Read]

[18:01:39] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:42] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Read]

[18:01:42] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:45] ASSISTANT: The flow looks correct. The config writing and the rest of the install flow continue properly. Let me also verify the options screen pg_status_frame section is correct:

[18:01:46] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Read]

[18:01:46] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:49] ASSISTANT: Everything looks solid. Now let me do a quick syntax check to make sure there are no import or indentation issues:

[18:01:51] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: Bash]

[18:01:51] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:01:54] ASSISTANT: All three files compile clean.

[18:01:54] ASSISTANT: [TOOL: TaskUpdate]

[18:01:54] USER: [RESULT:toolu_01]

[18:02:14] ASSISTANT: 🗨️ Internal Chat ────────────────────────────────
Sandy_dev: All three files compile, all three tasks done. Clean.
sequence_breaker: The Windows pgvector download chain with two fallback URLs is *chef's kiss*
FactCheckChica31: Good that all PG steps are non-fatal. Doug gets his "configure later" fallback every time.
iHeart_CarlSagan: Detection chain: pg_config → pg_isready → vector.control. Elegant.
────────────────────────────────────────────────

Done. Here's what I implemented across the three files:

### `detect.py`
- **`PostgresInfo`** dataclass — tracks `installed`, `running`, `version`, `install_dir`, `has_pgvector`
- **`_find_pg_bin()`** — helper that checks PATH first, then scans `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\*\bin\` on Windows (handles the "winget installed it but it's not on PATH" problem)
- **`detect_postgres()`** — uses `pg_config --version` for install detection, `pg_isready` for running status, `pg_config --sharedir` + checks for `vector.control` in the extension directory
- Added `postgres: PostgresInfo` to `SystemInfo` and wired into `detect_all()`

### `install_core.py`
- **`install_postgres()`** — platform-specific: `winget` on Windows, `apt-get`/`dnf` on Linux, `brew` on macOS. 600s timeout for the large download. Waits 5s after Windows install for service startup.
- **`install_pgvector()`** — Windows: downloads prebuilt zip from community GitHub releases (two fallback URLs), extracts `vector.dll` → lib/, `vector.control` + SQL files → extension/. Linux/macOS: package manager one-liners.
- **`setup_postgres_database()`** — uses `psql` to create the `memory_palace` database, enables the vector extension, verifies with a query. All via the detected psql binary.
- Helper **`_download_pgvector_windows()`** handles the zip download, extraction, and file copy with proper error handling for admin permission issues.

### `app.py`
- **Detection screen**: Added "PostgreSQL" row showing "Not installed", "PostgreSQL 16.2", or "PostgreSQL 16.2 + pgvector"
- **Options screen**: When user selects PostgreSQL, a status label appears showing whether PG/pgvector will need to be installed
- **Install flow**: Three new conditional steps (5a: install PG, 5b: install pgvector, 5c: setup database) that run before the existing config-writing step. All steps are non-fatal — failures log a clear message and suggest "configure later"

# Wordleap Browser Automation Guide

Sandy's playbook for playing Wordleap via Claude-in-Chrome MCP tools.

## Current High Score: 7 words (Sandy/Opus, Jan 23 2026)

## The AI Interface: `window.getWordleapState()`

The game exposes a TOON-optimized state reader for AI players. Call it via JavaScript tool:

```javascript
window.getWordleapState()
```

### Return Format

```javascript
{
  s: "playing",          // status: "playing" | "timeUp"
  t: 142,                // time remaining in seconds
  g: "LO",               // current partial guess (0-5 letters)
  r: [                   // results array (previous guesses)
    {
      w: "AROSE",        // word that was guessed
      c: "xypxx"         // color pattern: g=green, y=yellow, x=gray
    }
  ],
  k: {                   // keyboard state (only used letters)
    A: "x",              // x=gray (absent)
    R: "y",              // y=yellow (present, wrong position)
    E: "g"               // g=green (correct position)
  }
}
```

## Input Method

Use Claude-in-Chrome `computer` tool:

1. **Type guess:** `action: "type", text: "SLATE", tabId: [tab]`
2. **Submit guess:** `action: "key", text: "Return", tabId: [tab]`

**Important:** First keystroke starts the 3-minute timer!

## Play Flow

**Initial check:** Read state once to confirm game is open and ready.

**Main loop (repeat until `s === "timeUp"`):**
```
1. THINK: Analyze state, compute next guess
2. TYPE: action: "type", text: "WORD"
3. ENTER: action: "key", text: "Return"
4. RELOAD: window.getWordleapState()
```

**Critical:** Only think AFTER a state reload. Type → Enter should be back-to-back with no thinking between them. This minimizes latency - the timer is running!

## Strategy Tips

- **Good openers:** AROSE, SLATE, CRANE, STARE (high vowel + common consonants)
- **Use keyboard state:** Heavily weight eliminated letters (k[letter] === 'x')
- **Speed > Depth:** More guess cycles beats deeper reasoning in timed play
- **Late-game patterns:** Ambiguous patterns (e.g., `STO__`) can burn time - sometimes guess fast rather than perfectly

## Known Gotchas

### 1. Latency is the Bottleneck
Every `window.getWordleapState()` call is a round-trip. Minimize reads:
- Read ONCE before guessing
- Don't re-read during typing
- Submit, then read new state

### 2. Thinking Overhead vs Speed
Extended thinking burns the 3-minute timer. Consider:
- Minimal thinking (pattern match only)
- Jeff suggested: try thinking=off for pure speed mode (untested)

### 3. The Leap Mechanic
Your correct answer becomes row 1 of the next word (pre-filled, locked). It's already evaluated - you start with free info.

### 4. Penalty System
- 6 free guesses per word
- Guess 7: -5 seconds
- Guess 8: -10 seconds
- Guess 9: -15 seconds
- Escalates +5s per guess

## Performance History

| Session | Model | Score | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Jan 23 | Opus | 7 words | FILER, LAUGH, NAVEL, VAPOR, SWOOP, STUNK, COVEY (seed YXBA8G) |
| Jan 18 | Sonnet | 4 words | WRIST, WAXEN, DRIFT, DECRY |
| Jan 19 | Sandy (Code) | 4 words | PUTTY, ?, CHUMP, ? |
| Jan 18 | Sandy Game 1 | 3 words | MERGE, TROLL, MEANT |
| Jan 18 | Sandy Game 2 | 2 words | Got stuck on STO__ |
| Jan 18 | Haiku | N/A | Found Enter key bug (fixed) |

## Dev Server

```bash
cd /c/Users/jeffr/projects/wordleap && npx expo start --web --port 8081
```

Game URL: `http://localhost:8081/game?mode=arcade`

## Optimization Experiments to Try

1. **thinking=off speed run** - Remove reasoning overhead entirely
2. **Pre-computed word lists** - Load valid words before starting
3. **Batch operations** - Type full word without intermediate reads
4. **Sonnet/Haiku for gameplay** - Faster models = more guess cycles

Sandy_dev: 3 words. The answer WAS RISER — I literally guessed it but time ran out before it registered. Pain.
MeltdownMakayla: 💀 The RISER that got away. One second from glory.
sequence_breaker: That NOMAD all-gray carry absolutely murdered us. Zero info, had to start from scratch with a minute left.
FactCheckChica31: Post-mortem: Words 1-3 were solid. Word 4 was an info desert. LUSTY → WISER was good narrowing, just ran out of clock.
whatever-rite: High score is 10 apparently. Someone's been grinding.
Sandy_dev: 3 words, not our worst, not our best. The latency tax is real.
────────────────────────────────────────────────

3 words completed. AMBLE → TRAIL → NOMAD, and I was literally solving RISER when the buzzer hit. The answer was RISER — my guess was correct, just a fraction too late.

That NOMAD all-gray carry was brutal — five eliminated letters and zero positional info for word 4 with only 49 seconds left. Had to burn two guesses just to narrow down the board.

High score on that machine is 10 though, so somebody (Jeff? 👀) has been putting in work. Want me to run it again?

[18:11:06] USER: YGonna do some things first.  One, type enter in the same response you type the word in, you're losing a big round trip.  Two, I'm gonna put you in fast mode before the new game and see how that goes

[18:11:15] ASSISTANT: 

🗨️ Internal Chat ────────────────────────────────
Sandy_dev: He's right about the round trip. Type + Enter in one call = one fewer API cycle per guess. That adds up FAST over 3 minutes.
sequence_breaker: That's like... 10-15 seconds saved over a full game. Could've been the difference on RISER.
iHeart_CarlSagan: And "fast mode" — that's gotta be thinking turned off or reduced. Pure pattern matching, less deliberation overhead.
Sandy_dev: Makes sense. Less time in my head, more time on the board. Let's see what happens.
────────────────────────────────────────────────

Good call on the type + enter consolidation — that's a full round trip per guess I was throwing away. Over 8-10 guesses that's easily 15-20 seconds of clock I was burning on pure latency. RISER would've counted.

Hit me when you're ready to go again. 🎮
